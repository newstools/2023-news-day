CHOLERA has hit parts of Mudzi district where nine suspected cases have been recorded so far. A notice by health officials in the district said at least nine people are suspected to have been infected by the deadly disease in ward 3, Chimukoko area.   “Ward 3 Chimukoko in Mudzi district, Mashonaland East province recorded nine suspected cholera cases as of May 28, 2023. Please let’s practise good hygiene through washing our hands after using the toilet, washing our hands before eating anything, eating hot food, drinking clean water and avoiding hand shaking," read the notice. Efforts to get a comment from Mashonaland East provincial medical director Paul Matsvimbo were fruitless yesterday as he was not answering his mobile phone. Mudzi Rural District Council chief executive officer Victor Nyamutswa confirmed the outbreak saying they are ensuring provision of clean water to the affected communities.   “The information I am getting from the district medical officer is that we have nine suspected cholera cases in ward 3. One of the affected villagers has since tested positive to cholera while the remaining are still suspects. We are ensuring that there is availability of clean water in the communities so that we combat the disease,” he said.
