A 17-YEAR-OLD boy from Nkulumane in Bulawayo allegedly fatally stabbed his neighbour last year over a position in a queue at a communal borehole. His lawyer Marry Nyika of Macharaga Law Chambers said the boy would appear before a Bulawayo High Court judge on May 23 facing a murder charge.   It is alleged that on August 31 2022 at 3:30pm, the boy who was 16 years and whose name could not be published for ethical reasons, and the deceased identified as Tinashe Gweshe (22), intended to fetch water at a Nkulumane borehole when a misunderstanding broke out. The misunderstanding led to a fistfight, resulting in onlookers restraining them and the boy went home. At around 4pm the same day, the accused returned to the borehole and confronted Gweshe.   The accused then reportedly hugged Gweshe and stabbed him in the lower abdomen. Gweshe allegedly sustained a deep stab wound and was admitted at Mpilo Hospital where he died on September 2, 2022. Nyika indicated that there were nine witnesses in the case.
