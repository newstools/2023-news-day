ZPC Kariba Football Club player Winston Mhango(35) who was arrested at the beginning of this month after being found with dangerous drug has been freed on $60 000  bail and is expected back in court on June 13 for trial. The State ordered the accused to reside at his given address in Bulawayo.   He was also asked to report to the Bulawayo Central Police Station every Friday. On May 1, 2023, detectives from CID Kariba acted on a tip off and arrested Mhango Winston Mutulasoni, alias Bagga (35), in connection with unlawful dealing in dangerous drugs.  The arrest led to the recovery of various dangerous drugs.   Mhango’s arrest comes three months after former Harare City striker Jerry Chipangura was sentenced to 14 months in prison for possession of crystal meth in June 2022.
