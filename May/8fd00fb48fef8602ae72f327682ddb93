IN a bid to turn their team into a formidable force in the Ruvimbo Funeral Central Region, Kwekwe United have turned to three Zimbabwean soccer legends. Kwekwe United have confirmed the appointment of Agent Sawu, Chipo Tsodzo and Ronald “Gidiza” Sibanda into the team's technical team.   Sawu takes charge as the head coach, and will be assisted by Tsodzo while Sibanda will be the team manager. The three are expected to help Kwekwe United turn the corner in the second tier division where they are angling to gain promotion into the topflight league. Club owner Phil Makerera explained their blueprint to NewsDay Sport, saying the trio have been tasked with helping the team win promotion into the Premier Soccer League (PSL).   "We have hired Agent Sawu as our head coach. He will be assisted by Chipo Tsodzo and Ronald Sibanda will be the team manager," Makerera said. "They are already on the ground and we hope they will play a big part as we seek elevation to the PSL. Their credentials suit what we want as a club." Last season the former Warriors star, Sawu was in the Bulawayo Chiefs structures. This is his first coaching gig in the Midlands province. He joins the Kwekwe-based club with a wealth of experience alongside the revered Tsodzo and Gidiza.   So far Kwekwe United are yet to hit good strides in the Ruvimbo Funeral Central Region, as they are on position eight after four games, with five points on their tally.
