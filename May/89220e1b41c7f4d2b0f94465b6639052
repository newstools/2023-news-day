NON-GOVERNMENTAL organisation Terre des Hommes (TdH) Italy in Zimbabwe has established 34 community learning centres in Chipinge and Chimanimani district through support from the European Union.    TdH education officer, Lindiwe Ndoda, told NewsDay that the community learning centres were created to support government initiatives and to accommodate people who are not on school campus. "The community learning centres were established as a way to cater for the out-of-school learners including people with disabilities following the National Development Strategy 1 which talks about leaving no one behind. The TdH projects are for Cyclone Idai and COVID-19 recovery to restore proper learning activities," she said.    Chayamiti Primary School head Isiah Chuma said the project had helped bridge the digital divide.  "We thank TdH which is funded by the European Union to assist schools in remote areas. â€œTheir projects have improved the children's understanding of Continuous Assessment Learning Activities (Cala) despite the fact that some community members keep on demanding money from pupils who ask questions related to their Cala," Chuma said.
