THE recent fiasco surrounding General Notice 635 of 2023 has exposed a far-reaching crisis of competence, transparency, and accountability within our public information management system. As concerned citizens, we must delve deeper into the implications of this incident, which not only raises questions about the integrity of government’s decision-making process but also points to diversionary tactics at play. The premise upon which the President has rescinded the General Notice strains credulity and generates even more questions than answers. The notion that such a document could be gazetted in the President’s name without his knowledge and authority, and in full awareness of its nullity, is difficult to accept at face value. Gazetting legal instruments is not a mere event; it is a process steeped in legal and political protocols. Regardless of one’s political persuasion, this incident is deeply troubling and demands thorough examination.   It appears highly likely that the President, succumbing to public pressure, has concocted an unconvincing narrative to justify the withdrawal of the document. Similarly, the government spokesperson’s actions raise serious doubts about the credibility of the administration’s response. The possibility that the government, facing significant public pushback and embarrassment, chose to quietly withdraw the document to evade further scrutiny, is alarming. It implies an attempted circumvention of proper public consultation and due process. As deeply concerned citizens, we must insist that the government should: Conduct an exhaustive and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding General Notice 635, identifying and holding accountable the individuals responsible for this monumental blunder in public information management;   Implement rigorous checks and approval processes for all government documents and policies, ensuring the prevention of such incidents in the future; Establish a robust and transparent system of accountability, demanding that those responsible for errors in their duties be answerable to the public; Radically improve transparency in government decision-making processes, empowering the public to hold their elected officials accountable for their actions and fostering a culture of trust and integrity. This incident exposes a profound crisis within the current administration, marked by repeated failure and an alarming lack of accountability. It is essential that the public considers voting for a new government that prioritises competence, transparency, and public interest above all else. We, as citizens, deserve a government that works for us, not against us, and upholds the principles of democratic governance. - Vinthoughts   DEAR President Mnangagwa, So the news out there is that your government has written to Al Jazeera demanding evidence. At least that breaks the silence, but the demand is a bit suspicious. My view is that government should have demanded evidence from the people who featured in the Gold Mafia documentary. Al Jazeera’s role was to expose what was happening by airing the documentary. Why does the government not take a cue from the British government which is investigating its citizens who were implicated? Known people featured in the video, but we have not heard the government demanding explanations. In my view, which is shared by many, Al Jazeera played its part to expose the rot as part of its investigative journalism and authorities should demand answers from those implicated in the scam. Government should have suspended its ambassador-at-large Uebert Angel pending investigation if it is serious about curbing corruption. Government should also have questioned First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa and Henrietta Rushwaya who were allegedly called by Angel and were heard talking to him over the phone in the documentary. Since this is a serious matter, Angel should be pressed to identify the people he called. If government is not willing to investigate, it is my hope that the United Kingdom government can, in its investigation of Angel, establish the phone numbers he called. Also worrying is the fact that while Angel said they were actually investigating the Al Jazeera team indicating that the country’s intelligence was involved, the Central Intelligence Organisation has disowned the claim. Cleopas Chidodo has since made an apology that he falsely implicated former First Lady Grace Mugabe, and Angel and his team should consider following suit since lies have short legs. Zanu PF must stop playing games with the people of Zimbabwe.  Enough is enough. - Kennedy Kaitano THE excitement from the State-controlled media and the so-called staunch Zanu PF supporters about President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s invitation to witness the coronation of King Charles III is so astounding. They pretend to hate the whites yet inwardly they are craving for their help and re-engagement. Shockingly, when leaders of the opposition visit European countries they are branded sellouts and puppets of the West. The excitement, like that of a rural person who has paid their first visit to an urban area, has exposed the double standards of Mnangagwa’s government which always wants to dip everywhere for self aggrandisement. When Mnangagwa came from the 12th African Green Revolution Forum (AGRF) summit that was held in Kigali, Rwanda, last year in September and another one in Sharma El Sheikh, Egypt on the sidelines of COP27, he said former UK Prime Minister Blair had accepted to bury differences and was ready to work closely with him to propel the country back to its glory days. On Friday he again met the same warmonger to discuss bilateral relations. Since 2017 he has been holding such meetings, but with no success as investors continue to shun the country. If Mnangagwa is sincere and has the interests of citizens at heart, he should have not travelled to the UK given the state of our fragile economy. Mnangagwa must stop pretending to be a saint whenever he goes out of the country while he remains ruthless back home. There is an adage which says charity begins at home. No matter how much Mnangagwa might try to portray Zimbabwe in good light when he visits the West when back home nothing has changed, I don’t think he will achieve much in his re-engagement endeavour. Zimbabweans cannot protest against poor governance for fear of reprisals from a regime that is averse to dissent. Leader of Transform Zimbabwe Jacob Ngarivhume was jailed for inciting violence, so as Job Sikhala. Zimbabwe is being run by a ruthless, fascist mafia with absolutely no regard for human rights. - Leonard Koni
