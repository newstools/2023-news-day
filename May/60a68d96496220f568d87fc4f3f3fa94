MICHAEL “Magz” Magondo and hip-hop star Holy Ten have released a collaborative album titled The New Bhundu Boyz. Magz said it had been his dream to release music that is appreciated by fans around the country.   Following his discovery by Holy Ten last year, Magz was signed at Samanyanga Sounds together with Mr Candy. Magz told NewsDay Life & Style that they have been concentrating on single tracks until they decided to come up with an album. In December they released a song titled Marisa and in January this year they released another song which is making waves in the Zim hip-hop circles titled Pressure.   “After working on single tracks with Holy Ten which were hits in the country, we resolved to give our fans something different from our usual hip-hop as you know that music is evolving everyday so people should not get used to the same sound everytime,” said Magz during the launch of the album at Golden Conifer Gardens in Harare on Friday. “It took us months listening to different genres, getting familiar with it until we came up with the songs on the album. We combined our skills in music production and engineering to come up with a 11 track album titled The New Bhundu Boyz.” Holy Ten’s manager Shawn Maguma said the project was a result of the magic between the two artistes. “The New Bhundu Boyz album is a metamorphosis from the other previous Holy Ten projects. The fans just have to listen with shoe fits as he always says: “Kutaura nyaya semaziviro aanoita.”   He added that it was also inspired by love as Holy Ten recently married. Holy Ten married model Kimberly Chigubhu alias Richard’s.
