Sudanese officials say the army has suspended ceasefire talks with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), accusing the group of repeatedly violating previous truce agreements. The army took the decision "because the rebels have never implemented a single one of the provisions of a short-term ceasefire which required their withdrawal from hospitals and residential buildings, and have repeatedly violated the truce", a government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, has told the AFP news agency.   A Sudanese diplomatic source also informed the Reuters news agency about the army's withdrawal from the fragile ceasefire talks, which are aimed at enabling humanitarian access. Both the army and the RSF have not publicly commented on the said withdrawal. On Monday, mediators from the United States and Saudi Arabia said the army and the RSF had agreed to extend a humanitarian ceasefire by five days.   However, fighting continued in several parts of Sudan, including the capital, Khartoum, where the RSF said its positions had come under attack. The army said it had repelled an RSF attack on the central city of El-Obeid.
