BULAWAYO-BASED gospel singer Desire Nduru says his latest 14-track album Forgiven is a testimony inspired by his life experiences. “There was a time in my spiritual journey when I got ‘disfellowshipped’ from the church after breaking the commandment of pre-marital sex. It was a great disappointment,” he told NewsDay Life & Style.   “After a few years, I recovered and got re-baptised. This meant a lot in my life. I was so happy. Looking at what I had been through and given a second chance, I decided to record the album Forgiven.” Some of the tracks on Nduru’s latest offering are Jesus My Saviour, I Break the Chains, Learn to Trust, Thokoza and Uyangihola. Nduru recalled his musical journey from a tender age which led him to join a church choir and other singing groups at the church.   He recorded and released his first 11-track album titled Higher Ground in 2016 at the age of 22. “So, I decided to go solo. I tried it and saw it going well, then I proceeded. There are lot of things that inspire me to sing. First of all, it is the faith that I have. Believing in God gives me the reason to sing,” he noted. “Looking at creation, how we were made and all creation and looking at the love the Creator has for us, sending His son to die, I get so inspired.” A member of Seventh-Day Adventist Church, Nduru released his second 14-track album titled Till the Storm Passes By in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.   The album has tracks such as God on the Mountain, One Day at a Time and Yama Ezingalweni Zika Jesu. Nduru has been performing his songs at different church events around Zimbabwe and in South Africa.
