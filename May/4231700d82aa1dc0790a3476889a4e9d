The Ugandan parliament has passed a bill that increases paternity leave from four to seven days to enable male working employees to help their spouses. “It ought to be appreciated that if we wish to have a society where men play an increased supportive role to their spouses, it is important that more time be accorded to male employees to help their spouses,” Flavia Kabahenda, the chairperson of parliament's gender committee, said after the passage of the bill sponsored by the government.   The MPs said they borrowed a leaf from neighbouring Kenya which accords male working employees two weeks for paternity leave, state-owned New Vision reports. The parliament, however, rejected a proposal to provide additional leave days from the current 60 days to 90 days for female employees who give birth to more than one child at the same time. Attorney General Kiryowa Kiwanuka rejected the proposal describing it as extreme for the employers.   The bill has been forwarded to President Yoweri Museveni, who local media say is likely to assent it into law.
