Marvelous Nakamba is the toast of Luton after he helped his loan club complete a fairytale promotion to the Premier League. Luton Town have gone from non-league to Premier League in the space of a decade after four promotions. They will compete with the likes of Aston Villa in the Premier League for the first time since it was created in 1992.   Nakamba played a crucial role in Luton’s victory over Coventry City in the play-off final. He was confident and assured in midfield for much of the game before stepping up to score his penalty in the shoot-out after it ended 1-1. Coventry City substitute Fankaty Dabo was the unfortunate man who missed the decisive spot-kick to send Luton to the Premier League. It sparked scenes of despair in the Sky Blue half of Wembley, but scenes of jubilation amongst Luton’s supporters and players. Nakamba was handed a camera by Luton’s social media team to say a few words after the game. The Zimbabwean, who was clearly emotional, said: “The town is up. The town is up now. For you. The town is up. We did it together. Together!”   His future at Villa Park is unclear. Nakamba played very little football in the two seasons prior to his loan move to Luton in January. He has 12 months remaining on his Villa contract.
