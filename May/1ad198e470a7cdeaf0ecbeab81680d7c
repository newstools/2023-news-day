The Liberian electoral commission says it has begun investigating cases of underage voter registration and duplication of voter register, which violate the country’s electoral law. The National Elections Commission (Nec) said it uncovered the cases during an examination of the voter register, following the completion of data synchronisation from two counties.   Liberian law allows only citizens aged 18 and above to vote. Nec said all ineligible registrants will be removed from the poll register and prosecute any official found culpable of malpractices. In a statement released on Sunday it promised to soon announce the preliminary figures for the number of voters registered.   Nec is introducing biometric voter registration for the first time for the October presidential and legislative elections. The biometric voter registration was marred by technical glitches, including shortages of biometric cards that prevented some Liberians from registering.
