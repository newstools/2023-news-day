Jacky Sparrow has emerged as the bookmakersâ€™ favourite to land the 1 800-metre OK Grand Challenge following the unveiling of the final runners for one of the biggest horse-racing events on the calendar The OK Grand Challenge ranks along the Castle Tankard and the upcoming Republic Cup as the biggest three racing events at Borrowdale Park Racecourse.   Jacky Sparrow leads a strong field of 16 runners which also includes Ideal View, the surprise four-year-old winner of the May 6, Castle Tankard race. Nobody expected Ideal View at then 12/1 to take the Tankard which is 200 metres less than the OK Grand Challenge. Jacky Sparrow who is from the Debra Swanson yard opened betting at 5/2 with the closest competitor being Mind Master from the Vanessa Birke stable who is at 7/1.   Unfortunately for punters, Jacky Sparrow is coming out of not all that easy draw of 15 although carrying good weight of 52kgs. He should be wary of Dindingwe Debra from the Swanson yard who unfortunately should scare away punters by the weight of 57 kgs. All these bets could either fall or rise depending on the day of the race that is June 3, gets closer. Coming back after missing out of the Tankard is Wantage from the Bridget Stidolph yard as well as the filly True Beauty from the Thomas Mason stable who could not defend her Tankard title due to last-minute scratching.
