FORMER Zimbabwe international Khama Billiat has attracted the interest of Tanzanian football giants, Young Africans, who are popularly known as Yanga. Billiat, whose contract with Kaizer Chiefs is set to end on June 30, is uncertain whether he will get a new deal at the South African giants.   His manager Godfrey Bakasa has been mum about what the future holds for the star player. Some reports in the South African media suggested that the former Mamelodi Sundowns ace will be offered a one-year contract extension. However, Kaizer Chiefs have been quiet despite their commendable efforts to have him recover following a long injury lay-off.   Yanga, who recently won the Tanzanian league, have become the first club to register their interest in Billiat and they will dangle Confederation of African Football (Caf) Champions League football in their bid to snare him. Young African president Engineer Hersi Ally Said confirmed to FARPost that Billiat is one of the players on their radar. “If you ask me, he’s one of my favourite players. The type of quality he has is out of this world. So, why not, if we can get a chance of having him?” he said.  Said’s remarks follow the initial confirmation of interest by vice president Arafat Haji.   "He is a high-level player that we would like to have in our team,” Haji was quoted telling South Africa’s Isolezwe newspaper. “We know him and we know that his contract is ending. However, he is still a Chiefs player, we must respect that. “We will discuss the signing of players and plans for next season after the season is over.” Billiat recently recovered from a long-term injury he suffered in November last year. Although he is yet to start playing, the Harare-born attacker is back at training with the team, with just one game remaining before the season ends. He joined the club from Mamelodi Sundowns in 2018, but is yet to replicate the form he displayed at the club then under Pitso Mosimane.
