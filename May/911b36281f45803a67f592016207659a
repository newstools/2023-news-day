FORMER Warriors goalkeeper Washington Arubi has been honoured with the Marumo Gallantsâ€™ Chairman's Award for his sterling efforts at the South Africa-based club. Marumo Gallants were relegated at the end of last season after a drama-filled season.   However, Arubi was one of the exceptional players during the season along with striker Ranga Chivaviro. The ex-Dynamos player was a vital cog in Marumo Gallants' Caf Confederations Cup sojourn. They bowed out in the semi-finals after losing to Tanzanian champions Young Africans. In 30 games that they played in the league, Gallants only won five games, drew 14 and lost 11.   Arubi was given the award together with coach Raymond Mdaka, while the Midfielder of the Year gong was given to Lucky Mohomi. The Newcomer of the Year award was handed to Lesiba Nku, while Sibusisi Nkosi honoured for being the Most Promising Player. Lebo Mabotja and Lehlohonolo Nonyane got the Most Consistent Player and Best Leadership Qualities awards respectively. Striker Ranga Chivaviro won two awards, the Fan Favourite and the Striker of the Year.   The Most Prmonising Player Award was handed to Lehlohonolo Nonyane and Mpho Mvelase clinched the Defender of the Year gong. The Player of the Year award was given to Celimpilo Ngema.
