FOUR University of Zimbabwe students are set to appear in court today facing seven counts of malicious damage to property for allegedly painting “Free Job Sikhala” graffiti on government buildings and a church in the capital. Tawanda Benjamin Watadza, Emmanuel Chitima, Comfort Ncekuyenkosi Mpofu and Lionel Madamombe were arrested on Wednesday.   Chitima also faces a rape charge. It is alleged that the four, along with other accomplices who are still at large, on the morning of May 15, defaced the Parliament of Zimbabwe, High Court of Zimbabwe, Trinity Methodist in Zimbabwe church, Constitutional Court, Commercial Court, Harare Civil Magistrates Court and Runhare House buildings. They are alleged to have defaced the buildings by inscribing “Free Job Sikhala” and “Free Wiwa” on the walls.   They were initially charged with seven counts of criminal nuisance. The charge was later changed to malicious damage to property and, alternatively, criminal nuisance. They were supposed to appear in court yesterday, but the police indicated that they were still investigating the matter, with the possibility of arresting more students. The four are being represented by Darlington Marange of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum.
