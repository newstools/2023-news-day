ONE of Zimbabwe’s leading property developers, WestProp Holdings, has paid school fees amounting to US$7 500 and $609 000 for 112 orphaned children at Shungu Dzevana Trust Children’s Home in Harare as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR). Acting chief investments officer Tatiana Sharpe told NewsDay Weekender that the company had adopted a deliberate policy to reach out to less privileged members of society, including widows and orphans so that they live decent lifestyles.   WestProp has committed 10% of its profits towards the cause. “I know that this donation for scholarship fees made by WestProp Ltd Holdings will make a positive impact in empowering these orphans to receive equal access to education. I am proud of the CSR department for making this happen,” she said. “The fees have been paid out for this school term, and WestProp Holdings will continue to track the impact of such a donation in increasing quality education in Zimbabwe, measuring the increase in literacy and mathematic proficiency levels. This is done in accordance with reaching our national goals towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), primarily SDG 4: Quality Education,” she added.   The beneficiaries included 19 students from Hatfield Junior (Harare), 51 from St Boniface Primary (Gokwe), three from Martindale (Chegutu), 30 from Rio Zimbabwe (Mhondoro) and two in boarding at the same school, five at Nyangwene Primary (Chegutu) and two from Harare Polytechnic College. WestProp is also involved in a number of corporate social responsibility projects including the sprucing up of the Greenwood Park, support to various other children’s homes and assistance to women groups and cancer patients.
