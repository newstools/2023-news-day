WARRIORS midfielder Marshall Munetsi has been recognised for his good work off the field after receiving the 2022/23 Citizen Player Trophy in the French Ligue 1. Munetsi has been a shining beacon in France throughout the season, but it is his efforts to uplift the marginalised that have earned him a reward.   The 26-year-old received the award at a colourful event that was held on Sunday evening in France. The former Orlando Pirates midfielder shared his appreciation after he was given the gong. “For me this is a special trophy because that is something outside of football. It's something that is about helping other people, so I'm grateful that football players are also taking part in helping kids who are underprivileged, people who are disabled. I'm so grateful to receive this trophy and I hope that we continue to change people's lives outside football,” Munetsi said.   Earlier this year, Munetsi revealed that he donates 10% of his salary to less-privileged children in Zimbabwe. He has also donated football kits to a school in Mabvuku where he grew up. He has a special clause in his contract whereby Reims will donate 100 euro to his foundation for every kilometre that he runs in a match. Munetsi has also been at the forefront of lobbying the local football authorities and government to let bygones be bygones to help lift the Fifa ban on the country’s international football engagements. His efforts have also been commended by his Stade de Reims head coach Will Still who said: "He proves the importance he has for our team, but beyond that, I don't think you will find a better human being on earth than Marshall Munetsi.   “He is a great guy and a very good footballer. He manages to make others understand that there are more important things in life than just football. Having him in a locker room is key, he helps everyone around him to be the best person possible,” Still said recently.
