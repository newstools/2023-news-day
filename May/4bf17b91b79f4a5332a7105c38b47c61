RISING gospel artiste Obert Mandizira (33), popularly known as Omarivibes, has released a new single Ndoyita Seyi, a dedication to hard workers. Mandizira told Newsday Life & Style that the single is dedicated to people who work very hard, without achieving much and they end up turning to God for answers.   “This track is for someone who is working or someone who is running a business, but there is no outcome, then they turn to God trying to pray, but they no longer have strength left in them,” Mandizira said. “On this latest song, which is doing well and receiving good reception, I have worked with Danmag and Hard Mag. Together we have so far released about three singles. “Since day one it has been me, Omarivibes, featuring another artist known as Tornado in the gospel circles. We have released seven singles so far, working with many producers here in Bulawayo,” he said.   Mandizira said although he was yet to widely release his music on social media platforms, except on WhatsApp, he was happy with the positive feedback his music was receiving.
