HARARE-based e-commerce company, E-creator Zimbabwe is empowering youths to earn money from rating products produced by Chinese companies. The growing internet business takes advantage of the need for global companies that sell beyond their borders to have proper ratings to attract customers.   E-creator managing director Abraham Mutambu said:  “The business allows our customers to download their application, create an account and earn money daily after rating their products. This is how technology is creating opportunities for people.” He said with rising unemployment levels in Zimbabwe, E-creator brought an alternative for the youth who understand online business. One of the beneficiaries of the project, Norah Bvumba from Warren Park in Harare said the programme was a willing-buyer, willing-seller platform.  “I have been struggling to make money from many platforms on the internet, but E-creator has proven to be easy and authentic,” Bvumba said.   Africa Economic Development Strategies executive director Gift Mugano, however, said such schemes must be questioned as they could be ponzi schemes. “There is need for awareness of the existence of ponzi schemes or fraud schemes by law enforcement agents. Most importantly, the law enforcement agencies must apply the law on key actors of ponzi schemes without fear or favour. Zimbabweans, with their level of education, must always question any schemes which are very lucrative. It is a basic principle that you can't get returns on investment as if you are winning lotto. We must be patient when it comes to investment” Mugano said.
