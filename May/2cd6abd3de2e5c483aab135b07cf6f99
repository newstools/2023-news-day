FC PLATINUM gaffer Norman Mapeza is praying his charges take some momentum into their clash with Black Rhinos in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at the National Sports Stadium in Harare tomorrow. Mapeza and his men have had a tough start to the season where they have lost three out of their 10 matches so far.   However, the four-time champions are not far off the leading pair of Ngezi Platinum and Highlanders. They are on 15 points, just two points behind the early pacesetters. The Zvishavane-based side managed to claw back to winning ways with a narrow 1-0 victory over ZPC Kariba last weekend.   And Mapeza is hoping his men continue the winning spirit. “Last season both of our games ended in draws. The first one was a nil-all draw in Harare and the other one was a 1-1 draw, so it’s not going to be easy,” Mapeza said. “They haven’t been doing well of late and they brought in new coaches, new personnel. Definitely, I’m expecting a fight because these guys are looking for something. “I’m happy that we managed to win our last game but I can tell, we are still in the woods. It was very important for us to collect maximum points last week and I hope we will continue.”   Rhinos have been struggling and will be under pressure to collect maximum points and lift themselves out of the drop zone.
