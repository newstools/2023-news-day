A BELVEDERE woman was yesterday arraigned before Harare magistrate Evelyn Mashavakure to face charges of infanticide after she allegedly stashed her newly-born baby in a laundry dish. Therezia Makaka (42) was remanded in custody to tomorrow after indicating that she wanted to engage a lawyer.   The informant in this case is David Ngonidzashe Diza (46) who is Makakaâ€™s former husband. Allegations are that on May 13 this year at around 1:30pm, Makaka gave birth to a baby girl in her bedroom, while she was alone. She allegedly wrapped the baby in a cloth and hid the infant in a laundry dish. Diza reportedly discovered the lifeless body of the baby and reported the matter to the police.
