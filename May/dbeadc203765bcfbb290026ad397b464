LANDS and Agriculture minister Anxious Masuka has re-appointed Maud Manongwa to the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) board for a second term. Manongwa was first appointed in May 2018, and will now continue in the same position until May 2027.   In the letter of re-appointment dated May 16, Masuka said he re-appointed Munongwa because of her leadership skills which will later foster the Accelerated Irrigation Revitalisation and Development plans. "As the board member your role shall be in transforming Zinwa by providing leadership in water harvesting and conveyancing for 350 hectares under the accelerated Irrigation Revitalization and Development plan,” Masuka said. He said her services are required to reform Zinwa in providing co-efficient and accelerated borehole drilling services under the Presidential Rural Development Scheme which is targeting a total of 35 000 boreholes for villages by December 2025.   “Moreover, Manongwa has been assigned to improve internal capacity, capability and competencies to generate the requisite efficiencies for the delivery of seamless services. Lastly, she has been assigned to the development of self-sustaining financing mechanisms for Zinwa operations by December 2025,” he said.
