HIGH Court judge Justice Mangota has nullified former Cabinet minister Saviour Kasukuwere’s nomination as a presidential candidate. This follows an application by a Zanu PF member Lovedale Mangwana seeking an order declaring a decision by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) to accept Kasukuwere’s presidential nomination papers as null and void.   Mangwana said Kasukuwere’s candidature is in violation of Section 91 of the Constitution because he had been out of his constituency for 18 consecutive months. In his opposition papers Kasukuwere, through his lawyers Mhishi Nkomo Legal Practitioners, denied that he had been out of the country for 18 months and demanded Mangwana to prove his claim. Kasukuwere urgued that he left the country on a temporary basis on medical grounds.   He also said that he was a registered voter and was appearing on the voters roll in compliance with Section 91 of the Constitution. But Justice Mangota ruled that Kasukuwere had failed to provide evidence that he was out of the country on a temporary basis.
