FOLLOWING their convincing win over Chicken Inn in a Castle Lager Premier soccer League (PSL) match at Mandava Stadium over the weekend, Norman Mapeza believes his men are back in the groove. Mapeza believes his men will soon reclaim their “rightful position” at the top of the PSL log.   The defending champions beat Chicken Inn 2-0 on Saturday, to make an emphatic return to contention after a brief break. They were so convincing in every department that Mapeza was left on cloud nine, believing his men are back at their level best. “A lot was said about us conceding goals but we have rectified our problems. It’s always nice to keep a cleansheet. “It gives all of us some confidence especially our goalkeepers,” Mapeza said after the match.   As they face Dynamos in the next round of fixtures, Mapeza is confident they will sail through. FC Platinum have dominated the clashes between these two teams, and they will hope to continue their dominance. Even though Walter Musona was forced off the field of play due to injury, Mapeza believes he has enough arsenal to get the job done. As it stands, they are third on the log stadings with 24 points on their tally, two points behind leaders Ngezi Platinum. And that is enough to give Mapeza confidence as the league slowly moves towards boiling point.
