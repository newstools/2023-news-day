Former Bulawayo Chiefs coach Lizwe Sweswe has found a new home at Gweru based Sheasham Football Club, barely a fortnight after quitting the reigning Chibuku Cup champions. The club sacked John Nyikadzino, who helped them gain promotion into the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League from the Central Region Division One.   His last game was their nil-all draw against Ngezi Platinum Stars on Sunday. The Construction Boys are languishing second from bottom on the table with 12 points from 13 matches. Their only victory so far this season was in week seven where they edged army side Cranborne Bullets 2-1 at the National Sports Stadium. They have lost three times and drawn nine matches this season.    According to a statement released by the club, Sweswe has been engaged on a two-and-a-half-year contract with his immediate task being to help the club retain its place in the topflight league. Sheasham currently sit in the drop zone only above basement side Black Rhinos. “Sweswe has since signed a two- and half-year contract with the mandate being to steer the club to the next level which starts with survival from relegation, rising to making Sheasham FC a Zimbabwean football giant to reckon with, creating a legacy for the future generation to land on. Given his track record (Sweswe), and the club's objectives we believe that the prevailing environment will be conducive enough for the next level achievements as it has always been for his predecessor for the journey this far from the first division,” the statement reads. Sweswe’s first test will be against ZPC Kariba away from home. ZPC also have a new coach in Luke Masomere who joined the club recently.
