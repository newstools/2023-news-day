UROLOGICAL surgeon, Allen Chiura says he was motivated to become a surgeon by an injury he suffered while playing rugby when he was 16 years old. The Zimbabwe-based surgeon studied medicine at an American university and furthered his medical education at the Medical College of Pennsylvania.   He served as a urology resident at Howard University Hospital and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Urology is a part of healthcare that deals with diseases of the urinary tract. Speaking in an interview with Alpha Media Holdings chairman, Trevor Ncube on the platform In Conversation with Trevor, Chiura said: “Urology pit is an interesting medicine. When I was 16 years old, I played a lot of rugby and I had a knee injury that landed me at St Anne’s Hospital and my surgeon was the late Chris Mushonga who I adored. He did my surgery and I did very well.   “My mother was a nurse and so I had this sort of interest that was there already, but then when I (was) injured, I really wanted to go into medicine, I wanted to be a sports medicine doctor. At the medical school, my adviser happened to be a urologist. I didn’t know what urology was, but I used to see him leave the hospital grounds generally at about 4:35pm everyday ... and I remember thinking whatever this man does, I wanted to do that and that is how I pursued urology,” he said. Chiura is teaching medical students and training urologists. He also operates a surgery, Ecosurgica, which offers neurological and urology services. “The reason why we started Ecosurgica is that healthcare is one of the most polluting industries when it comes to the environment and so the eco bit was really to try and find ways to be environmentally sustainable,” Chiura said.
