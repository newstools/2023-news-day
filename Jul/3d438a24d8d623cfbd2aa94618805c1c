THE Zimbabwe Diamond and Allied Mineral Workers Union (ZDAMWU) has challenged union leaders to acquaint themselves with labour laws to effectively represent workers in the wake of escalating unfair labour practices countrywide. “As we continue to push for reforms within our National Employment Council and the impending Labour Act, ZDAMWU's focus will be to educate and train shop floor leaders, to equip them with skills suitable to represent union members,” ZDAMWU secretary-general Justice Chinhema said.   “We urge all leaders at every level of the union to acquaint themselves with the available labour laws to provide quality services to union members. Union leaders should be conversant with the pieces of legislation that speak to their day-to-day roles” The call came a few days after the Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG) and ZIDAMWU implored the government to address the poor working conditions currently prevailing in the mining sector. “The country is endowed with abundant mineral resources that have the potential to alleviate its economic woes. The government has set a target of developing a US$12 billion mining industry by 2023, underscoring the significance of mining for the nation's prosperity. There has been little focus on the crucial role mine workers play towards the attainment of this vision," partly reads the joint CNRG and ZIDAMWU statement.   The two organisations noted that the most significant stakeholder in this entire spectrum, mine workers, continue to suffer numerous injustices and gross violations of their rights. “Companies are hiring workers on short-term contracts. This denies the workers job security, pension, medical aid andthe right to join a trade union and participate in trade union activities. “This employment practice intimidates and silences workers from demanding improved working conditions and their rights as enshrined in the country's Labour Act and Constitution,” further read the statement.
