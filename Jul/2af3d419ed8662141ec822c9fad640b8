THOUSANDS of Johanne Marange Apostolic sect members are gathered in Marange for their annual passover, the second after the death of their leader Noah Taguta Momberume last year. His death ignited a wrangle  over the control of the church.   The church held its first annual passover in July last year despite sharp divisions within the church. Mutumwa Nimrod Taguta is the current leader of Johanne Marange Apostolic Churc Nimrod was ordained Johanne Marange Apostolic Church high priest after the death of his father Noah.   After the death of the leader, President Emmerson  Mnangagwa secretly visited the sect’s headquarters in Bocha. Mutare West legislator Teedzai Muchimwe (Zanu PF), who is also a senior member of the church, said: “We started our annual passover recently and it is expected to end this week. I am a senior member of the church, and so I will be responsible for welcoming church members from across the region and around the world.” Zanu PF Mutare West candidate for the forthcoming harmonised elections Nyasha  Marange, who is also a member of the church said: “I am part of the church and there is no way people can say I am campaigning, after all my church and Zanu PF have a good relationship and this is the reason why our (President) is always here.” In 2021, the church was in the eye of a storm after defying COVID-19 regulations by holding its annual passover after gathering had been outlawed.
