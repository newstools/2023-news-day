ZIMBABWE might have fallen short in their bid to qualify for the ICC Men's World Cup in India but veteran allrounder Sean Williams has been recognised for his individual exploits after being named amongst the nominees for the ICC Men's Player of the Month award. It was a month to remember for Williams, who was a shining light for Zimbabwe even as they fell agonisingly short of earning a spot in the 50-over World Cup at the end of the year.   The 36-year-old veteran helped himself to three centuries at the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament on home soil. Williams started the event in a blaze with an unbeaten 102* against Nepal and then managed scores of 91 and 23 in matches that followed against the Netherlands and West Indies. But it was after that that the left hander really shone, with the 36-year-old reaching triple figures in consecutive matches as he hit a brilliant 174 against the USA and then 142 versus Oman.   With this nomination, Williams aims to become the first Men’s Player of the Month from Zimbabwe since Sikandar Raza was honoured in August 2022. Meanwhile Williams will battle it out for the ICC Men's Player of the Month award with Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Harasana and Australia's Travis Head. Hasaranga propelled Sri Lanka through the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe with an inspiring run of wicket-taking spells while Head emerged as the star as Australia clinched ICC World Test Championship Final victory and carried this form into the ongoing Ashes series against hosts England.
