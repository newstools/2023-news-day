People in Omdurman, the city adjacent to Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, have told the BBC that conditions are dire after two days of intense clashes between rival military factions. “In the neighbourhood where I dwell, al-Thawra, there is a single hospital that is still operating and providing services to the sick and injured, but it suffers from a major shortage of medical supplies and a lack of the working staff,” one resident told the BBC’s Sudan Lifeline programme.   Another person explained how they were struggling to find bread. “A number of neighbourhood groceries and markets have been out of service for a long period of time and many merchants have abstained from selling their goods because of continued shelling and gunfire, which threaten their lives.” A vicious power struggle between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted in mid-April causing a major humanitarian crisis and forcing nearly three million people from their homes.
