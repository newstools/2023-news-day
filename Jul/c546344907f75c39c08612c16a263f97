BY STAFF REPORTER STANBIC Bank donated 1 600 reusable sanitary pads and 800 undergarments to 400 girls at Nyava Secondary School in Mashambanhaka, Shamva district, at the weekend.   The 400 girls, from Form One to Upper Six, did not only receive reusable sanitary pads and undergarments but also got invaluable information on  hygiene issues from Talia Women’s Network. Stanbic Bank acting head of brand and marketing Tariro Memo, said menstruation and access to sanitary pads were some of the biggest challenges faced by girls especially in the rural areas. Memo said Stanbic Bank made a deliberate decision to play its part in alleviating the plight of the underprivileged girl child.   “Stanbic Bank has comprehensive corporate social investment initiatives some of which are carefully designed to cater for the needs of the girl child through educational scholarships and, as in today’s case, support for menstrual health challenges,” said Memo. She said Stanbic’s support stemmed from the knowledge that young girls often missed lessons during their menstrual cycle due to lack of access to sanitary wear. Talia Women’s Network director Saliwe Zakariya said menstruation affected everyone including boys and men. “The most important aspect of menstruation is attention to detail regarding hygiene. It is important to bath twice a day especially when one is on their period,” said Zakariya.   Last year, Stanbic Bank donated 775 sanitary pads to primary and secondary schoolgirls around the country. Follow us on Twitter @NewsDayZimbabwe
