A 21-YEAR-OLD Chitungwiza man appeared at the Harare magistrates court on Friday facing allegations of possessing crystal methamphetamine (crystal meth) valued at $4,9 million. Liberty Gavaza appeared before magistrate Stanford Mambanje who remanded him in custody to July 13 and advised him to approach the High Court for bail.   It is the Stateâ€™s case that on July 5, this year, police received information that the accused was dealing in dangerous drugs in Chitungwiza, supplying the drugs using a silver VW Polo registration number ADR 8789. Acting on the information, detectives from CID Drugs and Narcotics proceeded to Chitungwiza after being tipped off that the accused was heading for Dema communal areas to supply the drugs. It is alleged that the detectives spotted the accused's vehicle driving along the Harare-Wedza road until it reached a dust road linking to Zhanje Village, Dema.   The detectives trailed the vehicle and later cornered the driver in the village. The detectives identified themselves and proceeded to body search the accused, leading to the seizure of one big and four small satchets of crystal meth that were found in his possession. A further search was conducted on the vehicle, but nothing was found. The accused was subsequently arrested and escorted to CID Drugs and Narcotics Harare where a field test was conducted on the drugs which tested positive for crystal meth.   The drugs were weighed and recorded approximately 62 grammes with a street value of $4,9 million.
