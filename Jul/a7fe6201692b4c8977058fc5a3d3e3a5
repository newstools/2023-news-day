COMPETITION and Tariff Commission head of legal and corporate services Jonathan Dube has been re-elected to serve a second term as president of the Chartered Governance and Accountancy Institute in Zimbabwe (CGAIZ). Lifneth Moyo and Judith Buzuzi were elected vice-presidents.   Moyo has extensive experience under Empretec Zimbabwe where she has provided leadership, management and business development and co-ordinated entrepreneurship programmes, while Buzuzi is an executive withdiverse private and public sector experience in business leadership, agriculture and insurance. In 2021, the institute changed its name from the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators in Zimbabwe to CGAIZ in line with that of the global institute of which it is a division. The name places emphasis on the governance role of the institute and its members.   Dube said his focus during the year ahead would be on encouraging the institute and its members to evaluate their performance benchmarked against the institute’s goals and values. He also said progress was being made to reduce corruption in the country. “There is no country without any corruption. What we need to do is try to reduce it to minimal levels. While there is still a long way to go to reduce it to a minimum, I think progress is being made in the right direction,” he said. The CGAIZ president said the institute was contributing towards the nation’s attainment of its Vision 2030 goal of becoming an upper-middle-income economy by 2030 through the promotion of good governance and the training it was providing to various State agencies.   In line with government’s decentralisation thrust, it had opened a branch in Bulawayo.
