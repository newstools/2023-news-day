LIFE coach and leadership expert, Deborah Tigere, has described the market’s response to her new book, Leadership Colouration, as positive. The book, published by Royalty Books, was launched recently at a colourful ceremony at Celebration Church in Borrowdale, Harare.   “The market positively responded, especially towards the launch as I continued to profile some of the key messages,” Tigere told NewsDay Life & Style. “I am planning to organise speaking engagements and that can motivate more people to buy the book.” Tigere said her coaching experience inspired her to pen the book.   “I realised that leadership is about the people around me, how I can support and influence them to achieve goals. I decided to contribute towards the topic of leadership to build the capacity of people to achieve the same leadership mastery,” she said, adding that her book was unique as it related to practical experiences on leadership in the Zimbabwean context. “The book demystifies leadership, unpacking the key elements of leadership relating to practical experiences.” Writing the book, Tigere said, was not easy because of tight timelines and other challenges associated with transitioning from report writing to book writing. “For someone who has experience in writing reports and articles, I was not sure whether my manuscript would meet the standards of a book. But I just continued to write,” she noted.   Tigere said her leadership experience significantly influenced the book. “Each chapter speaks to the experiences that I have encountered. Be careful of leaders who take you to places where they have never been,” she said. Tigere said she was grateful to God, who endowed her with the wisdom that has shaped her into an effective leader.
