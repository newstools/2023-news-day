THE Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) disowned a fake post circulating on social media platforms claiming that over 70% of registered voters for the August 23 elections are in the rural areas. The post features a Zec logo and claims that the figure was based on data from the commission’s website.    The post claims that 3 801 967 people are registered in rural areas while 1 976 381 people are in urban areas. “This post did not emanate from the Zec office and the commission distances itself from such,” Zec said in a tweet. “Members of the public are discouraged from abusing the Zec logo for personal gains.”   “We urge the public to be wary of such posts and to only rely on information from the Zec website or from our official social media platforms,” Zec said. The electoral management body said it is confident that this year’s elections will be free and fair. “We are committed to ensuring that the upcoming elections are free, fair, and credible,” Zec said. “We urge all eligible voters to register to vote and to participate in the elections.”
