The Zimbabwe national cricket team have blown one of their two shots at collecting two points that will buy them a ticket to the World Cup finals with a crushing nine wicket defeat to Sri Lanka, who with that win qualified to the global showcase in India. Both teams went into the match unbeaten and needing just a win to make it to the finals and it was the Asians who hit the bull’s eye in a win which was delivered by their bowlers, particularly Maheesh Theekshana (4 for 25) and Dilshan Madushanka (3 for 15) while Matheesha Pathirana claimed two scalps at the expense of 18 runs in three overs.   Zimbabwe were blown away in 32.2 over for a measly total of 165 runs. Pathum Nissanka (101) led the chase with a century while Kusal Mendis as unbeaten on as Sri Lanka cantered home in 33.1 overs.   Richard Ngarava claimed the wicket of Dimuth Karunaratne (30) after combing with Brad Evans who completed the catch. For Zimbabwe in form Sean Williams shone again with the bat but his 56 runs off just 57 deliveries was not backed by any of the other batsmen as Sikandar Raza making the second highest score with 31 runs.   After losing the toss, Zimbabwe never got going with Madushanka blowing the top three away as Joylord Gumbie went without scoring while Craig Ervine and Wesley Madhevere were dismissed for 13 and 1 respectively. A fourth wicket collaboration between Williams and Raza yielded 68 runs before the latter fell and was soon followed by the former, who was castled by Theeshkana. Zimbabwe still have their in their own hands as a win over Scotland tomorrow will give them a ticket to the India finals as well as a berth in Sunday’s final of this tournament at the Harare Sports Club.
