BLACK Rhinos coach Saul Chaminuka is confident that the club will survive relegation in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League after guiding them to their first win in 13 matches following a  2-0 victory over Yadah FC at Baobab on Saturday. Veteran striker Lot Chiwunga scored a brace which helped Chauya Chipembere grab their first set of three points since the 1-0 win over Cranborne Bullets on opening day of the campaign, four months ago.   The struggling army side recorded three draws and suffered nine defeats during the long poor run making themselves favourite candidates for relegation this season. It was also Chaminuka's first win in seven matches since he took over at the beginning of May. “I am more than excited. I am more than happy with this win. As they say, good things are worth waiting for, I have waited for a very long time. I have been here two months, now I am into my third month and the win has been eluding me,” Chaminuka said after the match.   “Now that we have started winning, I hope we are not going to stop. The team will survive. I have always said we will survive now the boys are confident they know that they can win and after a performance like this I am hoping that now we are marching" Despite the win, Rhinos remain anchored at the bottom of the log with nine points from 14 matches. However, they managed to reduce the gap between themselves and fellow strugglers Sheashan from five to three afterthe weekend matches. This week Rhinos host Hwange at Bata Stadium in Gweru where they will be looking to get a second win on the trot. Follow us on Twitter @NewsDayZimbabwe
