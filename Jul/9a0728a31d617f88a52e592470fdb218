FOLLOWING the weekend loss to Green Fuel in the absence of coach Lizwe Sweswe, Bulawayo Chiefs have moved with speed and appointed Joseph Sibindi as assistant coach. Sweswe watched from the terraces as The Ninjas lost 2-0 to Green Fuel as he protested over unpaid salaries and alleged interference by the club’s leadership.   His handlers had written to the club to indicate that he would not sit on the bench on Saturday if his salary issue was not resolved. Goalkeepers’ coach Nkosiyazi Ncube took charge of the team in the Green Fuel defeat. Sibindi, a Caf A Licence holder is likely to take over if the talks with Sweswe hit a brick wall. In a statement, the Ninjas said Sibindi’s appointment is in line with club licensing regulations.   “In fulfilment of club licensing regulations, we are thrilled to announce that we have appointed Joseph Sibindi as assistant coach of the senior team. Sibindi comes in as assistant coach to Lizwe Sweswe, who remains our head coach. Welcome, coach Sibindi” the statement read. Sibindi is not new at Chiefs where he was appointed head coach in 2019 following the departure of Garthly Chipuka. The Ninjas host Caps United, who make a return to Bulawayo at the weekend after entertaining Highlanders at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday.
