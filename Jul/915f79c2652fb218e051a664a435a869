BULAWAYO Chiefs have shown the door to five senior players as they brace for Caps United in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match slated for Luveve Stadium today. The Ninjas have axed senior players Kudakwashe Musharu, Last Jesi, William Stima, Rodrick Mufudza and goalkeeper Herbert Rusawo.   Musharu has joined Sheasham while Danny Phiri has been linked to a Chicken Inn return while Obriel Chirinda is said to be joining either Highlanders or bouncing back to Chicken Inn in the current transfer window. The duo is available for the Caps United tie, but skipper Malvin Mkolo will miss the match as he sits on three yellow cards. There has been no joy for financially-troubled Bulawayo Chiefs whose head coach Lizwe Sweswe resigned during the week before being replaced by Joseph Sibindi.   Sibindi says he is ready for the Green Machine despite the challenges in his camp. “Caps United are a big side and they play good football, but nevertheless we are not saying we are a bad side either.  We are a good team despite the fact that the team has lost two games and drawn an equal number. It is something that we are trying to work on. One thing I can say is that we will be there to compete,” Sibindi said. Makepekepe lost 2-1 to Highlanders on Sunday in a match played at Barbourfields Stadium. The Lloyd Chitembwe-coached side had fallen to Cranborne Bullets in their last game a month ago before the PSL took a month-long break.   Caps United sit ninth on the log table with 17 points, just a rung behind the Ninjas who have collected 18 points. Caps played a blinder at Barbourfields Stadium last Sunday despite falling to Highlanders, and Chitembwe was not devastated by the loss.
