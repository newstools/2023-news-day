SOUTH Africa’s ruling ANC party secretary-general, Fikile Mbalula, says immigrants are putting a severe strain on that country’s social services. His statement comes at a time when Zimbabweans in the neighbouring country have been given a further six months to regularise their stay or face deportation.   Zimbabweans and other African nationals have been subjected to xenophobic attacks as locals in that country blame them for taking jobs and other opportunities. During a meeting that sought to suggest changes to immigration policies, which include amendment proposals on citizenship, immigration, and refugee protection last week, Mbalula said ANC was not backing down on its plans to resolve immigration challenges in South Africa. “Illegal immigrants put a heavy strain on the fiscus with adverse effects on service delivery, the overstretched health sector, high unemployment, and poverty,” Mbalula said.   “Illegal immigrants have been a ticking time bomb for the country, which has been an albatross for the ANC-led government to accelerate service delivery at a faster pace. The outbreak of violence, as attested to by the violent attacks in Diepsloot, which happened on June 21, 2023.” “The ANC calls upon all communities to exercise restraint to avoid damage to property, life, and limb.” The meeting was attended ANC's top leadership including Home Affairs minister Aaron Motsoaledi. Last year, Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba sparked controversy after she was filmed telling a female patient that migrants from Zimbabwe were a “huge strain” on the provincial healthcare system.
