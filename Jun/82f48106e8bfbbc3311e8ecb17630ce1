AN Epworth man has been arrested after he allegedly fatally struck his wife for refusing to unlock her phone. Paul Mutezo (35) was on Wednesday arraigned before Harare magistrate Munashe Chibanda on a charge of murder.   He allegedly woke up in the middle of the night and struck his wife with an iron bar for refusing to unlock her phone. Mutezo was advised to apply for bail at the High Court and return to court on June 24 this year. Allegations are that on June 1 this year, Mutezo had a misunderstanding with Tsitsi Munemo over alleged infidelity.   Unsatisfied with Munemo’s explanation, Mutezo, on June 12, woke up in the middle of the night to go through his wife’s phone messages but the phone could only be accessed through a password. The incensed Mutezo allegedly struck his wife with an iron bar more than once on the head while she was sleeping, inflicting serious head injuries on her. Munemo later succumbed to the injuries.
