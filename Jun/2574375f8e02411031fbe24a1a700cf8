THE Reformed Church in Zimbabwe (RCZ) has remembered the less privileged by donating foodstuffs and goods worth US$10 000 to Henry Murray for the Deaf School and Copota School for the Blind in Masvingo province. Eaglesvale Junior School, an RCZ-run institution, mobilised blankets, mattresses, lotions, building materials, which include doorframes and doors, and foodstuffs for the two schools.   Speaking during the handover ceremony over the weekend, Eaglesvale headmaster Henry Mhaka  said: “We are training our pupils to learn to share with the less privileged. We know there are things that they no longer use and these come in handy for those from ordinary backgrounds.” Eaglesvale board chairperson Winston Makamure said the corporate sector, among them Union Hardware, provided massive discounts for some of the items bought from their outlets. Providence Human Capital and members of Royal Golf Club’s Silver Foxes team also chipped in with donations.   RCZ education secretary Julius Mutumburanzou said the church strove to achieve inclusivity in education by taking in pupils with disabilities who are usually neglected by society and do not have money for school fees. He said the donations would go a long way in alleviating the plight of the differently-abled students at the two special needs schools. “These institutions are donor and government-funded. The pupils come from disadvantaged backgrounds and do not have fees. Some are neglected, but as an institution, we continue with the drive to offer special needs education so that the differently-abled students are not left out in the learning process,” he said. Henry Murray, named after its founding missionary, was established in 1943 and caters for 240 students with hearingimpairments. Margaretha Hugo Schools (Copota), established in 1915, houses 330 pupils in primary and secondary schools.
