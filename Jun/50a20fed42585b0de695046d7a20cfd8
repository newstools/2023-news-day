A FARM worker in Hwange, Matabeleland North province, and local villager were last week acquitted of attempting to kill a fish poacher. Mqondisi Ndlovu (41), a villager at Railway Farm in Hwange and Choice Ncube (51), a farm worker at Bingwa Farm were represented by Thulani Nkala.   They pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges when they appeared before Hwange regional magistrate Lindiwe Maphosa on Thursday. Prosecutor Thulani Ncube told the court that the complainant in the matter was Mathew Zulu (40) of village 4 in Hwange. He said on October 30, 2022 at Bingwa Farm dam, Zulu was fishing with his four friends Douglas Ncube, Polite Nyathi, Inos Moyo and Brian Shoko.   They saw nine men armed with shotguns approaching the dam. The State averred that Zulu and his friends then fled the scene to avert arrest, but he was shot on the leg and fell down. Zulu stood up and tried to flee, but Ndlovu shot him again on the left leg before arresting him. Zulu, however, filed a police report accusing the duo of trying to kill him. The magistrate ruled that the State failed to prove its case against Ndlovu and Ncube.
