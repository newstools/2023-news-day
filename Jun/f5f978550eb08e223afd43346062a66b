WRITER and publisher, Faith Mudiwa Chipangura is driven by a strong desire to promote the publishing industry as well as uplifting up-and-coming writers. She founded Phoenix Publishing as a result of her desire to grow the literary industry and has published 12 books in five years.   Born in Plumtree, Matabeleland South province, Chipangura is determined to promote a reading and writing culture in various communities. “Phoenix Publishing was birthed out of a personal need as an author to see the literary industry do better, promote local writers and their work. I had written five books then I felt the reception and recognition wasn’t coming, so to close that gap I decided to create an organisation that is writer and reader-centred. “In essence, it recognises writers for their work and efforts through annual awards in 16 categories and nurtures up-and-coming writers through our mentorship programme for under-30 writers as well as publishing master classes.   “The goal was and still remains to resuscitate the seemingly forgotten industry and promote a writing and reading culture in our communities. Outside of these programmes, we are a fully functional publishing house offering a wide range of publishing services traditionally, hybrid and online at relatively affordable prices to afford writers a chance and opportunity to publish their work,” Chipangura said. Her life experiences and the desire to encourage other women to venture into entrepreneurship motivated her to start writing. Her journey has taken a lot of effort and sacrifice and she cautioned up-and-coming writers that it is not an easy road, but through determination, all things will fall into place. “Pursue your passions without holding back. It won’t come easy but stay the course anyway. Have enough discipline to follow your convictions and the rest will slowly but surely fall into place,” she added.
