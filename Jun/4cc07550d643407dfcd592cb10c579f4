Stand-in captain Sean Williams smashed a magnificent career-best score of 174 off 101 deliveries to inspire Zimbabwe to their biggest victory in ODIs following a dominant 304-run victory against USA in their final group match at the on-going ICC World Cup Qualifiers in Harare, on Monday. The win against the USA meant the Chevrons, who had already qualified for the next stage of the qualifiers with a match to spare on Saturday, maintained their perfect record in the qualifying competition.   Despite making four changes to the team which beat the West Indies, Zimbabwe, led by Williams’ remarkable innings, reached a match winning total of 406 for six in their allotted 50 overs. The score surpassed Zimbabwe's previous highest total of 351 against Kenya in a 2009 match played in Mombasa. In reply USA were dismissed for 104 in 25.1 overs as Zimbabwe not only bagged their biggest win by runs in this format but also the second biggest victory by runs in men’s ODI cricket.    Zimbabwe are on top of their group with eight points and will be riding super high on confidence before entering the all-important Super Six stage where they face Oman at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Thursday.
