FINANCIAL services group Old Mutual Zimbabwe held financial literacy training for women at the Harare Agricultural Showgrounds to champion financial education for previously marginalised groups.  The training was hosted by Old Mutual in partnership with Audacious Women, a women-only organisation.    “Old Mutual has been running its flagship financial education program “On The Money” which ensures that people have the tools they need to make good financial decisions for a better future, while opening doors to those who may have been previously financially excluded,” said Lillian Mbayiwa, Old Mutual Executive Head Group Marketing Public Affairs and Sustainability.   “We want Zimbabweans to thrive in their respective day-to-day activities,” said Mbayiwa.  “On The Money training sessions are open to anyone and everyone at no cost and are built on our relationships with the people, communities, and businesses that drive Zimbabwe’s growth.”    Deputy Minister of Women’s Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprise Development, Jennifer Mhlanga graced the workshop.  Minister said women should focus on acquiring wealth, creating assets and encouraging each other to have a culture of saving and planning a secure retirement.   “I urge Old Mutual to maintain the partnership with women organisations and the Small to Medium Enterprise sector because they drive the economy. Women need to be capacitated and empowered to be contributors to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP),” she said.  Pamela Gwanzura, the executive director of Audacious Women said: “To gain financial knowledge and skills, we have decided to partner with Old Mutual because women in our network are keen to learn from Old Mutual’s money experts and be able to put those insights into practice. “
