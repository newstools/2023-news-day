POLICE have arrested 39 suspected members of the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) party for alleged violence which occurred in Nyatsime, Chitungwiza, over the weekend. The CCC supporters appeared at the Chitungwiza Magistrates Court yesterday facing public violence allegations and were remanded in custody pending bail hearing.   The 39, who included Adam and Trevor Furukiya, Tashinga Chihaka and Donald Mugondegwa among others, are challenging placement on remand. The State was being represented by Michael Reza, Malvern Mwendera, Faith Simango and Munyaradzi Karimazondo while Freddy Masarirevhu, Noble Chinhano and Darlington Marange from the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO represented the defence. Allegations are that on June 8 at about 5pm, the CCC supporters went to Nyatsime area, Chitungwiza, where they destroyed Zanu PF cell offices, several houses and also assaulted members of Nyatsime community with bricks and sticks.   They allegedly stole cash and cellphones from residents. The State further alleged that the supporters were positively identified by the complainants. It said the CCC supportersâ€™ accomplices were still at large and the release of the accused will further dampen any prospects of arresting them.
