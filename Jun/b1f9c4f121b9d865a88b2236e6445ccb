The Premier Soccer League (PSL) has announced that the domestic league will take a three week break to allow maintenance work on reticulation being carried at the National Sports Stadium, and also to allow the playing field to regenerate. The Stadium is being used by up to eight PSL teams this season including Dynamos, Caps United, Herentals College, Yadah, Black Rhinos, Cranborne Bullets, Simba Bhora and Zpc Kariba, with at least five matches being played every week. The fixture congestion has put a huge strain on the playing surface, while fans have also been complaining at the sorry state of the ablution facilities at the stadium.   The majority of the ablution facilities have broken down forcing the stadium owners to close some bays in recent weeks. In a statement, PSL spokesperson Kudzai Bare said,    "This serves to advise that the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League is taking a break with immediate effect and will resume on the 1st of July, 2023. This has been necessitated by the maintenance work on water reticulation being carried out at the National Sports Stadium and to allow the playing field to regenerate. We also expect refurbishment works at Rufaro, Nyamhunga and Sakubva stadia to be completed before we resume Castle Lager Premier Soccer League matches."
