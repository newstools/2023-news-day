AWARD WINNING arts promoter 2 Kings Entertainment has added July Festival to its calendar of events with the inaugural event set for July 29 at The Odyssey in Kadoma. The one-day festival will be headlined by South African Afro-pop outfit Blaq Diamond which is not new to the local showbiz scene.   Blaq Diamond, made up of  Ndumiso Mdletshe and Sphelele Dunywa, will share the stage with local stars Ammara Brown, dancehall chanters Nutty O and Uncle Epatan. Posters advertising the festival have already been splashed across the country. Speaking to NewsDay Life & Style yesterday, festival co-ordinator Dee Nosh of 2 Kings Entertainment said the July Festival would be an annual event added to their calendar. “We are sticking to our commitment to give people great entertainment, that’s the reason we are introducing the inaugural July Festival featuring both local and international artistes on one stage,” Dee Nosh said.   “The award-winning Blaq Diamond from South Africa will be the headlining act. We have decided to release the advance tickets on time to ease pressure on fans. The early bird tickets are selling at US$5 and US$15 VIP, respectively.” Dee Nosh said the festival was meant to further provide a platform for local artistes to share notes with international talent. “We are just looking forward to a great and memorable show,” he said. Blaq Diamond appears to have made Zimbabwe its second home as evidenced by the number of their recent performances across the Limpopo River. So far, they have performed in Harare, Beitbridge, Gwanda and Bulawayo.   The Odyssey is increasingly becoming the home of showbiz, hosting both local and foreign acts. Among the artistes that have performed at this venue are Congolese soukous singer Koffi Olomidé, top South African acts DJ Tira, Afro-pop group Mafikizolo and Makhadzi, a multi-award-winning songbird.
