AFTER publishing her debut book Daily Grace: A Devotional for Women about two years ago, entrepreneur-cum-author Maxine Adams has produced another one titled Her Crown was Grace, a valuable resource book for women seeking spiritual guidance. The 31-year-old Adams reckons that she has been writing for many years, but in this latest book, she felt called to create a devotional specifically for women.   “It took me about two years to carefully craft each entry and ensure that the book (Her Crown was Grace) would be a valuable resource for women seeking spiritual guidance. I wanted to make sure that the book was as comprehensive and impactful as possible before releasing it to the public,” Adams explained. While writing the book, she recalls she had time to also read works by other Christian writers. “When I was working on this project, I read extensively from other Christian writers. Their insights and perspectives helped me deepen my own understanding of faith and inspired me to create something truly meaningful for my readers,” she said.   Reflecting on her first publication, Adams said she used the opportunity to minister the word and to speak to herself too. “As a woman of faith, I wanted to create something specifically tailored to women’s spiritual needs, something that would speak directly to women’s hearts and help them deepen their relationship with God,” she noted. The book (Her Crown was Grace) was launched at a colourful ceremony in Harare and among the guests were songbirds Tammy Moyo, Shashl, fashionista Lilian “Hollywood Lee” Madyara, Erica Ndoro and Noxy the Diva, who was the master of ceremony. Afro-soul musician Bryan “Bryan K” Kadengu entertained the guests at the launch.   Away from book writing, Adams as an entrepreneur is the founder of a make-up brand called Christian by Hadassah. Launched early 2018, the make-up brand idea was a result of her fascination with make-up.
