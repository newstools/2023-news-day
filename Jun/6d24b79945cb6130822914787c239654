TELONE have surged to the summit of the Ruvimbo Funeral Central Region Division One Soccer League, as Chapungu and Tongogara fired blanks. The Gweru-based side has been ruthless and consistent, even without coach Tendai Chikuni who is on leave. On Sunday, they beat Beitbridge-based side CM Academy 1-0 in what turned out to be a hard fought win.   With Tongogogara and Chapungu playing out to a goalless draw, the WiFi Boys opened a four-point lead at the summit of the standings after nine matches. They have 23 points on their tally and they remain one of the three teams yet to taste defeat this season. Former Ngezi Platinum winger Blessing Sahondo has been the main driving force for the WiFi Boys this season, while former ZPC Kariba pair of Trust Nyabinde and Blessing Sibanda have also been top performers for the team. The other undefeated teams are Tongogara and Dulibadzimu.   Army side Tongogara are second on the standings with 19 points on their tally, while ZPC Munyati are third with 15 points. Former PSL side Chapungu are sixth on the standings with 13 points on their tally, which has all but left coach Clement Zuze facing the chop. Despite having probably the best squad in the Ruvimbo Funeral Central Regions Soccer League, Chapungu have been a pale shadow of themselves.
