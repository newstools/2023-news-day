Heal Zimbabwe Trust (HZT) has amplified calls for peace to prevail before and after the August 23 elections.In a statement, the peace watchdog appealed to all political stakeholders to promote peace, harmony and tolerance among their followers. “HZT joins the rest of the nation in remembering the more than 200 lives that were lost to political violence. We will not forget the thousands of Zimbabweans who were displaced, whose livelihoods were destroyed and their lives changed forever,” HZT said in the statement.   HZT called on the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC) to promote healing and reconciliation while also urging the Special Investigative Units established under the electoral law to prosecute all perpetrators of political violence.  “We urge all political parties to resolve all disputes amicably through the Multi-Party Liaison Committee. We call on the police to fairly execute their constitutional duties in the maintenance of law and order in line with the United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and enforce the law guided by section 219 of the Constitution,” the HZT statement added.
