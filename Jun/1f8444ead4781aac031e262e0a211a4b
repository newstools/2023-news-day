POVOAfrika Trust, a non-profit organisation focusing on social development through arts and cultural projects, has launched Musicable - a project aimed at supporting musicians with disabilities. Focusing on women with disabilities in the music industry, the mentorship program implemented in collaboration with Music In Africa Foundation (MIAF) and Goethe-Institut will capacitate artistes and facilitate their access to home recording tools.   “The project will also empower artistes by linking them to mainstream markets through mentorship programs with established artists,”Musicable’s spokesperson Rudo Chakanyuka said in a statement. “It is part of POVOAfrika Trust’s increased support to communities often excluded from significant opportunities across Zimbabwe.” Starting this month until September 15, Musicable will run in Harare, Bulawayo and Mutare with established songbirds Pauline Gundidza, Raven Duchess and Vuyo Brown mentoring rising artistes Chipo Muchegwa, Mpofu and Sithandazile Gumbo, respectively.   According to the United Nations, people living with disabilities include those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. As part of this current project, Musicable will also produce a documentary of the journey shared by the mentors and mentees. “The short film will highlight the challenges faced by artists with disabilities and how they work to overcome them, (it) will be complemented by capacity-building workshops that will bring together artists with disabilities, industry professionals, and leaders within the arts and cultural sectors,” Chakanyuka said.
