All-rounder Sikandar Raza starred with bat and ball to help Zimbabwe to a six wicket victory over Netherlands and claim a second consecutive win in the on-going ICC World Cup Qualifier at Harare Sports Club. Raza struck the fastest ODI century by a Zimbabwean batsman with a brisk 102 not out as the hosts chased down a challenging 316 target with relative ease.   There were half centuries from Captain Craig Ervine (50) and Sean Williams (91) in Zimbawe's successful run chase. Earlier in the day Raza had claimed 4 wickets for 55 runs as Netherlands finished with 315 runs for six. Raza was voted Man of the Match for his exploits.   Zimbabwe play West Indies next on Saturday at the same venue.
