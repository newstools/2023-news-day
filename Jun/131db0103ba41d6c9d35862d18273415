CHICKEN Inn will be hoping to continue from where they left before the season break when they clash with reigning champions FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium on Saturday, marking the resumption of the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. The GameCocks were on a three-match winning streak before the PSL suspended the league due to a stadia crisis.   They had dispatched high-flying log-leaders Ngezi Platinum Stars 2-0 at Luveve before mauling ZPC Kariba 3-0 at the National Sports Stadium. They also dispatched Black Rhinos 1-0 at home and those three victories saw them rise to third position on the table with 21 points, two behind Ngezi Platinum and just one shy of city neighbours Highlanders, who will be away to Caps United at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. FC Platinum, on position four, at par on 21 points with Chicken Inn did not fare badly in their last encounters either.   After a debilitating 2-0 loss to fellow platinum miners, Ngezi at Baobab Stadium, the Zvishavane-based side accounted for ZPC Kariba at home and played two away fixtures in which they rolled past Black Rhinos and Green Fuel.
