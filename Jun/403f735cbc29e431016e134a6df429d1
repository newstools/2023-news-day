WARRIORS international Tino Kadewere has saluted Spanish topflight football league side Real Mallorca for affording him the opportunity to “make history”. He returns to his parent club Lyon in France after a season-long loan.   Kadewere is being linked with a move to another French side Montpelier as Lyon are oversubscribed in the forward positions Kadewere was loaned to Spanish La Liga side RCD Mallorca last season after falling out of favour at the French Ligue 1 side. The former Harare City star still has one year remaining on his Lyon contract. However, it does not look like he will spend the rest of the year at the club.   Lyon have a potent attacking department which has Alexandre Lacazette, Rayan Cherki and Bradley Barcola. Kadewere paid tribute to the RCD Mallorca as he returns to his parent club. “What an experience, great atmosphere, amazing team, the best fans, history was made. All I can say is Thank you for everything Real Mallorca,” he said. One Football reports that Montpellier HSC are interested in his services as they look to replace striker Elye Wahi, who is being courted by many clubs.   Kadewere has not been at his best since returning from an injury spell. He scored two goals in the 19 matches he played for RCD Mallorca. Before that, Kadewere was on song in his maiden season at Lyon where he scored 10 goals and provided three assists. For Le Havre, he scored 20 goals in 24 games before he was signed by Lyon. Sadly, the 27-year-old has never been able to regain that blistering form. He has also been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia whose league is attracting big names by dangling huge sums.
