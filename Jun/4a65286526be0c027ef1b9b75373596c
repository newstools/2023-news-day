As the world commemorates International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) has urged the government end torture and holding perpetrators accountable. In a statement on Tuesday, ZLHR said all cases of torture must be investigated, including those involving members of the armed forces.“As an organisation dedicated to fostering a culture of human rights and seeking justice for victims of torture through litigation and other forms of redress,   ZLHR calls upon government to commit to eradicating torture by ratifying and domesticating the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,” ZLHR wrote. “(The government should) criminalise torture and investigate all incidents and prosecute all cases of torture (as well as) ensure full accountability of all perpetrators and guarantee redress and rehabilitation to victims of torture.” The International Day in Support of Victims of Torture is commemorated annually on June 26 in order to honour the victims and survivors of the crime of torture.   ZLHR called on the government to investigate all allegations of torture – including cases of excessive use of force by members of the security services – and prosecute those responsible. It also called for government should provide victims of torture with access to medical and psychological support.Meanwhile, the government of Zimbabwe is yet to ratify the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, despite signing it in 2019.
