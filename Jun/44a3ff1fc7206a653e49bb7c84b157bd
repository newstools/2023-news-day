THE Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) has bemoaned recurrent incidents of torture in the country mostly perpetrated by State actors. “The human rights lawyers … stand in solidarity with victims and survivors of torture and have assisted a significant number of people to obtain redress and to promote accountability for perpetrators who engage in these heinous practices, which have the effect of destroying the lives of victims,” the ZLHR said.   “Nonetheless, we are concerned that some architects of torture are yet to be held to account and we continue to receive reports of torture from across the country. “In recent years and months, the excessive use of force by members of the security services particularly members of the police against human rights defenders and ordinary citizens, has been commonplace, despite some progressive provisions contained in section 51 of the Constitution guaranteeing freedom from torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment.” Zimbabwe has continued to grab the headlines over gross human rights violations.   “ZLHR is concerned that the government of Zimbabwe has not ratified and criminalised torture, despite torture being a crime under international law and has been condemned as one of the vilest acts perpetrated by human beings on other human beings and cannot be justified under any circumstances." ZLHR called on government to domesticate the convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its optional protocol to eradicate the vice. “ZLHR calls upon government to commit to eradicating torture... and investigate all incidents and prosecute all cases of torture, ensure full accountability of all perpetrators and guarantee redress, and rehabilitation to victims of torture and ensure that monetary damages granted by courts in cases of torture are honoured timeously.”
