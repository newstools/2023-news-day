BULAWAYO-BASED events management company, 3D Media has set tongues wagging over alleged falling standards. The company used to dominate the events management space and was well known for staging concerts which were almost always headlined by South African acts including Mafikizolo, Oskido, Nasty C and amapiano star and Sir Trill, among others.   At one point, 3D Media had monopoly of all the concerts as the sole music promoter in town, prompting allegations of “mafiarism”. The show dubbed Park n Chill had supporting acts by DJ Liz, DJ Crazy Black, Umlungu Omnyama, Joe the OF, Mzistozz Mfanafuthi and Harare’s DJ Blaze. The latest punch on the events company came last weekend during Park n Chill which was headlined by South Africa’s Mas Musiq at Hartsfield.   One artiste, who asked not to be named for fear of victimisation, said: “Remember these guys used to be the go-to-people for an extended period of time. They got used to people stroking their egos and treating everyone like that, while getting away with it. Can you imagine artistes didn’t even have VIP tags? I noticed that some didn’t have any at all which meant that once they got in they were not free to move around in case bouncers kicked them out. I heard even other members of the Press were stranded at the gate. How come you had access?” 3D Media boss Mduduzi Mdlongwa could not be reached for comment as he was not picking calls. Last year, there was a public outcry that in all or most of his shows, the headliners from South Africa performed for not more than 30 minutes. Responding to NewsDay at the time, he said this was because that was the time they would have been booked for.
