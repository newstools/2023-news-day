Ugandan dance troupe Ghetto Kids missed out on the top three slots at the last stage of Britain’s Got Talent competition on Sunday, thanking fans for their "unwavering support through out the competition". The group of six children are aged between six and 13, and came from impoverished backgrounds in Uganda's capital Kampala before being taken in and cared for by their guardian-turned-manager Dauda Kavuma.   Ghetto Kids was among the 10 finalists in the competition – which was won by Viggo Venn, a 33-year-old comedian from Norway. The second place was taken by 13-year-old dancer Lilliana Clifton while magician Cillian O’Connor, 14, came third. The Ugandan group already made history after becoming the first act to be given a "golden buzzer" by one of the judges before they had even finished their performance - which sent them straight to the semi-final. They then received the most public votes, giving them a place at the final alongside nine other contestants.   It has added to the group's already considerable fame - the Ghetto Kids already had millions of YouTube views under their belts before joining the UK talent show, and featured in a music video for US-Moroccan rap star French Montana in 2017.
