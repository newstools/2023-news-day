MINING research and advocacy pressure group, Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG) executive director Farai Maguwu has petitioned Mines and Mining Development minister Winston Chitando to order a probe into the alleged fatal shooting of a mine worker at Bikita Minerals in Masvingo) early this year. In a letter dated June 27, Maguwu called for an inquiry and apprehension of a security guard who fatally shot Darlington Vito at the mine's dumpsite.    “We are writing to call on the Ministry of Mines to investigate the murder of one Darlington Vito by a security guard employed by Sinomine. The incident in question occurred on the 26th of March 2023 at a rubble site on the outskirts of Bikita Minerals where the security guard is employed to provide security services,” wroteMaguwu. He added: “This is a serious matter that requires immediate attention and investigation from your ministry. It is important that the investigation is conducted in a fair and transparent manner to ensure justice is served for the victim and their family. “Section 48 of the constitution of Zimbabwe guarantees the right to life. This right supersedes the right to protect property. We urge the Ministry of Mines to take appropriate action in this matter and ensure that the security guard and Sinomine are held accountable for the murder of Darlington Vito.”   National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi referred questions to Masvingo provincial spokesperson Inspector Kudakwashe Dhewa who initially professed ignorance of the matter but later said he would investigate and give an update. He had not done so by end of business on Thursday.
