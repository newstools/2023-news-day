THE Anglican Council of Zimbabwe (ACZ) says it is ready to mediate between political parties to de-escalate tension as the country heads towards the August 23 elections.Bishop Eric Ruwona of Manicaland Diocese, said the role of the church was to ensure peace prevails before and after the elections, whatever the outcome. “Allow me to state that the way churches operate differ. The Anglican Church in Central Africa does not engage in partisan politics,” Ruwona said.“We are very patriotic and engage in all matters of national interest. We are there as referees and mediate when politics and communities disagree. This is why we run more than 100 schools in Zimbabwe and hospitals and clinics because the welfare of our communities is of great interest to us.”   Ruwona made the remarks in his welcoming remarks at the Bernard Mizeki annual pilgrimage in Marondera recently.President Emmerson Mnangagwa was the guest of honour at the event that was attended by several government officials.“We take lessons from the giants such as the retired Bishop Dinis Sengulane of the Diocese of Lebombo in Mozambique. The Anglican Church was not liked by the Portuguese colonial government which favoured the Roman Catholic,” Ruwona said. “Despite that tag, the unique ministry is recognised internationally for helping to bring peace to Mozambique in 1992 after 16 years of civil war. “Consecrated as bishop in 1976, Bishop Dinis became one of Africa's greatest peacemakers with a mediation role between the rebel group Renamo and the Frelimo government.”
