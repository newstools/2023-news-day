KARIBA will for the first time this week host a charity drive that will start tomorrow ending on Sunday aimed at assisting under-privileged members of the community in the resort town. The event will be hosted by Face of Kariba (FOK), an organisation which seeks to celebrate the beauty and significance of Africa’s largest inland lake, Kariba.   FOK also raises awareness about the dam, its importance in providing hydroelectric power and its role in fostering sustainable development in the region. “The Face of Kariba campaign, along with its brand ambassadors, plays a crucial role in raising awareness about Kariba Dam’s importance and promoting sustainable development,” FOK founder and executive director Aloise Chimbangu said. “At the Face of Kariba, our mission is to create a positive impact in the lives of the disadvantaged members of our society, specifically targeting the poor and vulnerable in the Kariba community.”   He said the organisation firmly believed that partnerships will bring meaningful change to the community, while contributing towards building a better Kariba. FOK brand ambassador Geraldine Mandengenda added: “To achieve our goals, we recognise the importance of strong partnerships. We humbly request your participation as partners in this charity drive. Your support, in any capacity, will play a crucial role in uplifting the lives of those in need.” Meanwhile, the Kariba Publicity Association (KPA) also endorsed the drive describing it as a noble gesture. “We will facilitate in co-ordinating members who would have responded with any items for donation. As the association we value this partnership in building confidence to the community of the vital role we play,” KPA chairperson John Chirinda said.
