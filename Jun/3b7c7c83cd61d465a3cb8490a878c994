Police in South Africa are investigating a bomb hoax that temporarily disrupted flights at OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg on Wednesday afternoon. The South African airports authority (ACSA) said it evacuated passengers and staff after receiving an alert from an anonymous caller, alleging there was a bomb threat at the domestic arrivals section.   "As a result of this temporary disruption to normal operations, eight domestic flights were affected. ACSA's primary concern will always be the security of our passengers and staff, and it was imperative that action be taken immediately to ensure their safety," it said. The body said services resumed in the evening after investigations by the police revealed that there was no cause for concern. Police are continuing with investigations "to establish the origin and motive of the individuals behind this incident", it added.
