There is always a question mark on their integrity. The malpractices of Chinese construction companies operating in Africa have often been reported in the media. But such pieces of news do not seem to rattle these companies who still fail to keep their functioning above board.   Recently, Tuk Chilo Ltd, a local Kenyan firm, filed a court case against China Road and Bridge Corporation Kenya (CRBC) for failing to pay over Sh 44.3 million for the construction of various roads in Nairobi. Tuk Chilo Ltd. was subcontracted by CRBC to construct and upgrade roads in various informal settlements and densely populated areas in Nairobi Country. The business and operations of the Kenyan company have suffered irreparable loss and damages due to non-payment of dues. Notably, CRBC is in the process of winding up its operations in Kenya and moving back to China any time soon. In another incident of deceit, it was revealed that Chinese hackers targeted eight key ministries of Kenya including foreign and finance ministries and State departments from 2019 to 2022 in a bid to assess billions of dollars owed to Beijing.   The cyber-attacks also targeted the Kenyan Presidency and affected the National Intelligence Service (NIS) after the attackers secretly accessed email servers used by the spy agency. The ministries targeted were critical in the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative project.
