FORMER ZPC Kariba coach Godfrey Tamirepi looks set to be relieved of his duties at ZPC Munyati which compete in the Ruvimbo Funeral Central Region Soccer League. Tamirepi has been at the helm of the Midlands-based club since being demoted from his former club last year.   While everything seemed to be on course this season, it has emerged that the outspoken gaffer has fallen out of favour with executives at the club. An impeccable source in the ZPC Munyati camp told NewsDay Sport that Tamirepi could be leaving the club. “It's still an internal issue, but it’s true. There are a few steps that need to be taken. A lot has been happening behind the scenes, but soon it will be revealed to the public,” he said.   As it stands, ZPC Munyati are third on the log standings after nine matches. They have 15 points on their tally, with eight points separating them from log leaders TelOne is set to rejoin ZPC Munyati. Meanwhile, Rutherford Matondo who has been holding fort at Gweru-based side TelOne is set to rejoin ZPC Munyati. Matondo left ZPC Munyati at the start of last season to join TelOne where he worked with Tendai Chikuni as his assistant.
