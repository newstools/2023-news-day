Castle Lager Premier Soccer league side, ZPC Kariba FC have unveiled Luke Masomere as their head coach. Masomere takes over from Darlington Dodo who moved to Green Fuel FC to deputise Rodwell Dhlakama. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony on Wednesday, ZPC Kariba FC executive chair, Cosmas Zindoga urged everyone to work together with the coach and his technical team for results to improve. “I urge every one of us here to work together for better results,” said Zindoga. “Conflict is normal in any set-up but this should not deter us from producing good results. We need to avoid relegation at all cost as this is not an option for us.”   Masomere said he was going to work hard for the team to produce best results. “I promise every one of us here that as a team we are going to work hard for positive results, said Masomere. The Kariba-based outfit is currently in trouble following poor results.   Meanwhile, football fans in Kariba are ecstatic following the homologation of Nyamhunga Stadium. The team has been using the National Sports Stadium in Harare for its home matches which contributed to poor results attributed to fatigue. Kauya Katuruturu, as ZPC Kariba are affectionately known, will play Yadah FC at Nyamhunga Stadium tomorrow.
