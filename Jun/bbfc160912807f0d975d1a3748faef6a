RUVIMBO Funeral Central Region giants Chapungu FC have fired coach Clemence Zuze, just 10 games into the season.Zuze took charge of the airmen at the start of the 2023 season, with high hopes of dominating the lower tier league but they have struggled for consistency despite having what looks like a formidable squad on paper. Chapungu recalled most of their seasoned players who were on loan at Black Rhinos to propel their fight to return to the top flight. But they have been playing second fiddle to seasoned campaigners TelOne and army side, Tongogara.   Their latest 2-0 defeat at the hands of ZPC Munyati at home, all but triggered Zuze's sacking on Wednesday, with Tawanda Marimo taking over in the interim.“Chapungu Football Club wishes to advise esteemed members of the press and all valued stakeholders that it is parted ways with the coach Zuze.“The head coach's departure from the team's technical set up is part of a restructuring exercise aimed at reviving the club's chances of winning the Ruvimbo Funeral Central Region Soccer League and gain promotion to play in the country's top-flight football league. “The club would like to express its profound gratitude to the outgoing head coach for his dedicated service to team and wish him well in his future endeavours.”Chapungu are fifth on the log standings with 16 points.
