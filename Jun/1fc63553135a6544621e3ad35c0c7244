GOSPEL artiste, Obert Mandizira (33) popularly known as Omarivibes in music circles has released another track called Ndinotadza. Mandizira told NewsDay Life & Style that the track is talking to a person who admits to God that they sin and want to know how they can repent and start doing things the right way.   “The song is about a person who is admitting to God but does not know how they can go back to doing things the Christian way. It has a very powerful message if one takes their time to listen to it,” Mandizira said. Mandizira said he was prompted to release the song hard on the heels of a recent release due to pressure from his fans some of them from as far as South Africa. “I would like to thank God first, looking back from our previous song called Ndoita seyi, we have received so much support and encouragement from our fans. It pleases me that I even got support from people from South Africa which simply means that my music is being acknowledged from outside our borders. This on its own has pushed me to keep on singing,” he said.   Though social media views are not that much, he is pleased that there has been an improvement since he started his music career. “I am happy because at least we managed to have 200 views on YouTube. I have also received good feedback from my family, friends and other fans that saw  an article about my song and they started listening to my music,” Mandizira, who is determined to make a mark in the music industry, said. Mandizira said he and his colleague Professor “Tornado” Mpofu, both from Mangwegwe North, were not only gospel singers, but they also sang love songs as a duo. Follow us on Twitter  @NewsDayZimbabwe
